Using Rob at the following GIT address:

	https://github.com/rob5standingby/raspberry-pi-s3-cam

Need to install tinys3 to get the link to your own S3 bucket:
	pip install tinys3
	
I found that a bucket I created from the console didn't work, but you can use the make bucket command, s3cmd mb <name> to create a fresh one!
Just follow Rob's instructions and add your own S3 identity and shared secret to the config file, renaming it just config

After running for a number of weeks, the pi refuses to boot. It seems that some files on the card have become corrupt. Am attempting to pull back to here anything useful and will then reformat and programme the card
